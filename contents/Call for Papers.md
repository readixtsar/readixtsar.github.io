#### Motivation and Context

The growth of educational and assistive technologies for reading, aimed at enhancing the performance of individuals with disabilities, provides an important setting for Text Simplification research. The field of special education has had a longstanding interest in technology and the potential it holds for individuals with language/speech disabilities, cognitive disorders, etc. (Edyburn, 2000). This workshop aims to present state-of-the-art applications and approaches in technology-enhanced reading and innovations in text accessibility. The workshop will address specialized technology, tools, and resources, their impact on learning to read and comprehension, and innovative works spanning research to fieldwork, particularly in light of recent AI advances.

Research in automatic text simplification has evolved from deep learning methods (Martin et al., 2020; Maddela et al., 2021; Sheang and Saggion, 2021) to leveraging foundational large language models (Kew et al. 2023; Cripwell et al. 2023; Farajidizaji et al. 2024) through fine-tuning and prompt-engineering. Despite these advancements, the Text Accessibility and Text Simplification communities must address critical areas, including: designing better evaluation metrics, developing context-aware simplification solutions, creating appropriate language resources, deploying simplification in real-world environments, studying discourse factors, and identifying factors affecting readability. Addressing these issues requires collaboration across CL/NLP, machine learning, UI/UX, accessibility professionals, and public organizations, whom we invite to participate through publication and attendance.

#### Topics of Interest

The joint event will accept submissions at the intersection of the research areas of the two workshops, as well as submissions that are targeted to the specific research interests of either workshop. An indicative list of topics of interest are listed below.

- Lexical, syntactic and discourse adaptations or simplifications
- ATS for sentences, paragraphs, or documents
- Controllable text simplification and text generation of adapted contents
- Measuring and evaluating readability and text complexity
- LLMs and agentic LLMs for text simplification, text adaptation and readability
- The role of LLMs in supporting reading
- Complex word identification (CWI) and lexical complexity prediction (LCP)
- Models, corpora, lexicons for text adaptation and text assessment
- Evaluation of text adaptation or ATS systems
- Meaning representation and multimodal text adaptation
- Educational devices and/or smart technologies for supporting reading and learning
- Domain specific applications of the above topics (e.g. health, legal)

#### Submission Instructions

We invite submissions on topics of interest between 4 and 8 pages of content. The page limit of 8 pages does not include acknowledgements, references, potential Ethics Statements and discussion on Limitations in line with the policy of the main LREC conference. All submissions must follow the LREC stylesheet, available at [https://lrec2026.info/authors-kit/](https://lrec2026.info/authors-kit/).

Submitted manuscripts may contain appendices, however all information that is required for the correct interpretation of the manuscript must be included in the main body of the paper and reviewers will not be required to read appendices to form their final judgment of the work.

All submissions are double-blind. Any submissions which are not-anonymised, over-length, poorly formatted or make excessive use of appendices to circumvent page limits are liable to desk-rejection.

At the time of submission, authors are offered the opportunity to share related language resources with the community. All repository entries are linked to the LRE Map, which provides metadata for the resource.

##### "Share your LRs!" Initiative

When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your research.

Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC authors to share the described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.) to enable their reuse and replicability of experiments (including evaluation ones).

**As in previous editions for Camera Ready a Plain Summary will be requested.**
